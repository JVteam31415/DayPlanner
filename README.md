# DayPlanner

This project was conducted to create a hourly day planner for scheduling events. 

The Project has a date at the top, and 9 hour marks, from 9 am to 5 pm, which information can be stored in, presumably something indicating what should be done during those hours. This information is saved by the "SAVE" button and stored locally, and as such will be retained upon multiple visits to the page.

I learned how to use localStorage, moment.js, jquery.js, and how to create new elements in the html file from the js file.

I, James VanderKam, worked alone on this assignment.
